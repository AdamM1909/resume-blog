My name is Adam Myers. I'm currently a University of Manchester Therotical Physics undergraduate self-teaching the fundamentals of machine learning. I have a good a good mathemtical stating point but most of what I cover on this blog will be new to me. 

Specifically, this blog outlines how and what im learning. It includes content both designed to help people starting out and to showcase my understadning of the field. 

I hope to present some sucessful Kaggle entries in the near future to showcase my progress.
