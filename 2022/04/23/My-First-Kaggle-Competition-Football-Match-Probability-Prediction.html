<p><strong><span class="underline">A brief overview of the competition, my approach, and my score</span></strong></p>

<p>The aim of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/football-match-probability-prediction/overview"><span class="underline">this competition</span></a> was to predict the match outcome of 189 games of football using statistics from the team’s last ten games.</p>

<p>My general approach was to extract short, medium, and long term averages of different features included in or engineered from the original data set. I used feature importance from a decision tree forest to see if these signals had good predictive power or not before ensembling a few different kinds of models for a final submission.</p>

<p>The predictions were judged using a log-loss score so overconfidence was punished. I scored a respectable 1.00520. For context, the leader scored 0.98834, and the bookies 0.9730. My real aim for this competition was to get used to the end-to-end process of predictive modelling and to this means it was a success.</p>

<p>Here’s the screengrab which, at the time of writing, put me in 51st out of 288 position:</p>

<p><strong><span class="underline">Things I wished I’d known before starting</span></strong></p>

<p>I’ll put these in a list for ease:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Once testing is complete, train a final model with the whole data set provided - not just the training split. This hampered my progress quite a lot before I noticed but it was a valuable learning point nonetheless.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Don’t be afraid to do some hard coding. By this I mean looping through variable names caused complications and lead to mistakes. If in doubt just copy and paste a few times to be safe.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Use box and whisker plots or histograms after each newly added feature to check things went as planned.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span class="underline">Importance of understanding the dataset + thoughtful feature engineering</span></strong></p>

<p>Most of my gains didn’t come from the actual model I chose - in fact I hardly optimised these at all - they came from deriving useful metrics from the data and getting rid of useless ones.</p>

<p>By looking at how each feature split in a tree improves the model’s predictive power, feature importance can be gauged. Here’s a bar chart of my top fifteen features:</p>

<p><img src="https://AdamM1909.github.io/resume-blog/assets/img/2022-04-23-My-First-Kaggle-Competition--Football-Match-Probability-Prediction/media/image2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the variables are fairly self explanatory; however, I’ll add that ‘dif’ refers to a difference between the home and the away team; ‘1’,’2’,’3’ and ‘long’,’med’,’short’ refer to the respective time average taken; and ‘s/c’ is the difference between scored and conceded goals.</p>

<p>This shows how explicitly feeding the model differences really helps it categorise games. I was most surprised to see how ‘rest_dif_long’, which is the long term average rest differences between games between the home and away team, is judged as fairly important by the decision trees.</p>

<p>Team ratings were provided by <a href="https://www.octosport.io/"><span class="underline">Ocotosport</span></a>, and again the relative difference between the averages proved most useful.</p>

<p>I didn’t apply any explicit time series transforms to this data but I’d be interested to see how decomposing ratings trends into signal components with a fourier transform of some kind may provide extra signal - having said this, extra complexity always comes at a price.</p>

<p><strong><span class="underline">The models I used and their performance</span></strong></p>

<p>My final submission was an ensemble of a logistic regression model; a random forest mode; a light gradient boosted model; and a two layer neural network. Okay this was overkill but it was more for learning the strengths of different models - ensembling was just an easy extra kick up the leaderboard.</p>

<p>Surprisingly simple a logistic model alone would have scored very well. This speaks a lot for simple models and is definitely a good take away: start simple, the rest is limiting returns.</p>

<p>The shallow neural net extrapolated really well out of its training batch. I used fast.ai’s tabular model, which incorporates lots of under the hood tricks to work well on tabular data. Their high level API helped to split categorical and continuous features; make the entity embeddings for categorical features; and find a good learning rate for a learning rate varied fitting cycle.</p>

<p><strong><span class="underline">Places to improve and my next steps</span></strong></p>

<p>The glaring area for further research is running a grid search on my tree based models. To do this I think I’ll have to rent a better GPU as the free version on <a href="https://www.paperspace.com/"><span class="underline">Paperspace</span></a> simply took too long.</p>

<p>Having said this, for a first attempt, I’m happy with my performance as I picked up the main points about making a good model. Optimising little things is the aim of the game of Kaggle competitions but for me it’s about learning as much as I can.</p>

<p>My plan now is to learn some more about natural language processing models and do a deep dive into the maths behind.</p>
